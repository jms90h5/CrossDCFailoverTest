Improve documentation and reorganize repository structure

This commit includes several improvements to make the framework more user-friendly:

- Enhanced README with detailed Quick Start guide and better structure
- Renamed repository from "streams" to "CrossDCFailoverTest"
- Reorganized documentation files:
  - Moved design and implementation .docx files to docs directory
  - Renamed scripts/README.md to SCRIPTS_GUIDE.md for clarity
  - Created additional specialized guides (CONSOLE_USAGE.md, RHEL9_SETUP.md)
  - Consolidated review documents into DESIGN_REVIEW.md
  
- Added helper scripts to simplify common operations:
  - setup_env.sh - Interactive environment variable setup
  - check_status.sh - Verify configuration and prerequisites
  - run_test.sh - Simplified test runner
  - cleanup.sh - Tool to manage old test results
  
- Created archive_reviews.sh to maintain repository cleanliness
- Updated all cross-references to match new file locations

These changes make the framework more accessible for new users while preserving all the original functionality and documentation.
