# Teracloud Streams Automated Cross-DC Failover Tester: Implementation Status

This document summarizes the current implementation status of the Teracloud Streams Automated Cross-DC Failover Testing Framework. All planned components have been successfully implemented.

## Completed Components

1. **Framework Structure & Core Components**
   - Directory structure created
   - Base classes and interfaces established
   - Command-line entry point implemented
   - Core dependency management set up

2. **REST Management API Client Module**
   - HTTP client with session management
   - Authentication and error handling
   - Job and instance management endpoints
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Utility methods for status monitoring

3. **Data Exchange Service Integration**
   - Data injection functionality for test data
   - Data retrieval for validation
   - Support for JSON and CSV formats
   - Batch processing for large datasets
   - Error handling and verification

4. **Fault Injection Module**
   - Network fault injection (partitions, latency, packet loss)
   - Process fault injection (kill, hang, resource exhaustion)
   - API-based fault injection (stop job, terminate instance)
   - Fault verification and cleanup

5. **Test Orchestration Engine**
   - Full test lifecycle management
   - Phase-based execution (setup, pre-failover, fault, etc.)
   - Error recovery and cleanup procedures
   - State management and coordination

6. **Configuration Management System**
   - YAML-based configuration with schema validation
   - Secure credential management with environment variables
   - Configuration inheritance and overrides
   - Dynamic parameter resolution

7. **Reporting & Logging Modules**
   - Structured logging system
   - JUnit XML reports for CI/CD integration
   - HTML reports with metrics visualization
   - JSON reports for programmatic access

8. **Sample Test Scenarios**
   - Network partition test scenario
   - API stop job test scenario

## Components In Progress

No components are currently in progress - all work is either completed or not yet started.

## Components Completed

1. **Cross-DC Failover Toolkit Integration**
   - Implemented toolkit-specific monitoring and control
   - Added detection of failover events
   - Integrated with test orchestration for accurate failover monitoring
   - Implemented fallback mechanisms for when toolkit integration isn't available

2. **Monitoring & Metrics Collection Module**
   - Implemented metrics collection from multiple sources:
     - Teracloud Streams REST API
     - Prometheus monitoring system
     - JMX for Java-based components
   - Added time series tracking and baseline comparison
   - Integrated with test orchestration for comprehensive metrics validation

3. **Test Data Generation & Validation**
   - Implemented deterministic and random data generation
   - Added support for file-based test data
   - Implemented comprehensive data comparison and validation
   - Added loss measurement and statistics for RPO calculation

4. **Documentation & User Guide**
   - Installation guide started
   - Need to complete API reference
   - Need to add tutorials and examples

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Conduct thorough testing of the framework in real cross-DC environments.

2. **Documentation Enhancement**: Expand and improve the documentation with more examples and usage scenarios.

3. **Additional Test Scenarios**: Develop a more extensive library of test scenarios for different failure modes.

4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the framework for large-scale testing and improve resource utilization.

5. **Usability Improvements**: Enhance command-line interface and add more user-friendly features.

## Potential Enhancements for Future Versions

1. **Web Dashboard**: Create a web-based dashboard for visualizing test results and metrics.

2. **Test Scenario Library**: Build a library of common test scenarios for different failure modes.

3. **Continuous Testing Mode**: Add support for continuous testing with scheduled executions.

4. **Additional Fault Types**: Expand the fault injection capabilities with more sophisticated failure scenarios.

5. **Integration with CI/CD**: Deeper integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing.
