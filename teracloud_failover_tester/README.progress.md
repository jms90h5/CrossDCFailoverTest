# Implementation Progress Summary

The current implementation of the Teracloud Streams Automated Cross-DC Failover Testing Framework is now complete, with all planned components implemented.

## Highlights:

- Core framework structure and command-line interface are fully functional
- REST Management API client with comprehensive error handling is implemented
- Data Exchange client for test data injection and retrieval is complete
- Advanced fault injection capabilities (network, process, API) are fully implemented
- Test orchestration engine with full lifecycle management is ready
- Configuration system with schema validation and secure credential management is complete
- Metrics collection from multiple sources (API, Prometheus, JMX) is implemented
- Test data generation and validation with deterministic and random generators is complete
- Reporting system with JUnit, HTML, and JSON output is implemented
- Sample test scenarios have been created to demonstrate the framework capabilities
- Cross-DC Failover Toolkit integration is complete with monitoring and control capabilities

## Recently Completed Components:

- **Cross-DC Failover Toolkit Integration**:
  - Created CrossDCToolkitClient for interfacing with the toolkit
  - Implemented failover status detection and monitoring
  - Added service availability checking across data centers
  - Integrated toolkit metrics collection
  - Added fallback mechanisms when toolkit isn't available

- **Test Orchestrator Integration**:
  - Enhanced the test orchestrator to utilize toolkit client
  - Added improved failover detection in monitoring phase
  - Updated validation with toolkit-specific checks
  - Enhanced post-failover phase with toolkit status verification

## Next Steps:

1. Conduct thorough testing in real cross-DC environments
2. Fine-tune components based on testing results
3. Complete comprehensive documentation and API reference
4. Enhance documentation with examples and usage scenarios

Overall, the framework has a solid foundation with all core components implemented and is nearly ready for practical use in testing Teracloud Streams cross-DC failover capabilities.
