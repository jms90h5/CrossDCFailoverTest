## Issues Log

| ID | Location | Assumption | Actual Documentation | Impact | Recommendation | Severity |
|----|----------|------------|----------------------|--------|----------------|----------|
| D01 | 4.1. REST Management API | "Enhanced REST Management API in Streams 7.2" | Documentation confirms REST API version 7.2.0.0 is available | No issue - assumption is accurate | None needed | None |
| D02 | 4.1. REST Management API | Uses Python requests for API communication | API uses Basic Authentication as documented, which is supported by Python requests library | No issue - implementation approach is valid | None needed | None |
| D03 | 4.3. Cross-DC Failover Toolkit | "Configuration via REST Management API" | Toolkit documentation indicates it's primarily integrated via SPL composite operators and stream connections, not directly via REST API | Major - The design assumes direct REST API control of the toolkit, but it's primarily a stream-based integration | Update design to clarify toolkit integration is primarily through SPL application design, not direct REST API manipulation | Major |
| D04 | 4.3. Cross-DC Failover Toolkit | "Monitoring toolkit/application failover state" | Toolkit provides application-level status tracking but doesn't expose this directly via REST API | Major - The design assumes direct status monitoring via API, but may need to infer status from application behavior | Modify monitoring approach to infer toolkit status from application metrics and stream behavior | Major |
| D05 | 4.3. Cross-DC Failover Toolkit | "Conditional triggering of failover/failback (if supported)" | Toolkit documentation indicates automatic failover based on DC status monitoring, not explicit triggering via API | Major - Design assumes programmatic control of failover, but toolkit uses automatic mechanisms | Modify design to focus on testing automatic failover rather than programmatic triggering | Major |
| D06 | 4.2. Data Exchange Feature | "Pre-failover state seeding: Injecting test data into the primary DC" | Documentation confirms EndpointSource operator can receive data via REST API POST calls | No issue - assumption matches documentation | None needed | None |

| D12 | 8. KEY ASSUMPTIONS | "Common authentication mechanism for APIs (bearer tokens or API keys)" | Documentation indicates Basic Authentication is used, not bearer tokens or API keys | Minor - Authentication method assumption is incorrect, but impact is minimal as Python requests library supports both methods | Update to specify Basic Authentication is used | Minor |
| D13 | 8. KEY ASSUMPTIONS | "Toolkit exposes status information via API or metrics" | Documentation indicates toolkit status is primarily exposed through SPL streams, not directly via API | Major - Toolkit status monitoring approach needs significant adjustment | Design must be updated to infer toolkit status from application behavior and metrics rather than direct API calls | Major |
| D14 | 5.1. Justification for Python | Python libraries for HTTP/SSH/network manipulation | Documentation doesn't contradict these library choices. Python is appropriate for this task | No issue - technology choice is appropriate | None needed | None |
| D15 | 5.1. Justification for Python | Lists prometheus-api-client for metrics querying | Documentation mentions metrics retrieval is available via the REST API, so this approach is valid | No issue - implementation approach is valid | None needed | None |
| D16 | 6.1. API-Driven Failure Injection | "Stopping specific jobs/PEs in the primary DC" | Documentation confirms job management API supports stopping/canceling jobs | No issue - assumption is accurate | None needed | None |
| D17 | 6.1. API-Driven Failure Injection | "Testing Cross-DC Failover Toolkit response to administrative interventions" | Toolkit documentation indicates automatic failover based on DC status, not API interventions | Minor - Testing approach needs adjustment to focus on how toolkit responds to various failure conditions rather than direct API control | Clarify that testing will focus on toolkit's automatic response to failure scenarios, not programmatic control | Minor |
| D18 | 7.2. Data Flow for Validation | "Injection via Data Exchange API before failover" | Documentation confirms Data Exchange supports data injection via REST | No issue - assumption matches documentation | None needed | None |
| D19 | 7.2. Data Flow for Validation | "Processing by the Streams application across failover" | Toolkit documentation confirms application-level failover, so this is valid | No issue - assumption is accurate | None needed | None |
| D20 | 7.2. Data Flow for Validation | "Retrieval via Data Exchange API after failover" | Documentation confirms Data Exchange supports data retrieval via REST | No issue - assumption matches documentation | None needed | None |
| D21 | 9. POINTS REQUIRING CONFIRMATION | Document lists various points requiring confirmation | Documentation already provides information on most of these points | Minor - The design correctly identifies areas where more information was needed at the time | In the final implementation, confirm all these points have been addressed with the actual documentation | Minor |
| D22 | 9. POINTS REQUIRING CONFIRMATION | "Programmatic failover control capabilities" | Toolkit documentation indicates failover is automatic based on DC status, not explicitly triggered via API | Major - The implementation must account for automatic, not programmatic, failover | Update design to focus on testing automatic failover mechanisms rather than programmatic control | Major |
| I01 | 1.1. Purpose of the Document | "Current inaccessibility of key Teracloud Streams documentation resources" | Documentation is available and comprehensive | Minor - The implementation document acknowledges limited documentation access, which is no longer an issue | Update to reference actual documentation | Minor |
| I02 | 3.1. REST Management API | "Assumed capabilities" for the REST API | Documentation confirms these capabilities are available | No issue - assumptions match actual capabilities | None needed | None |

| C02 | streams_client/crossdc_toolkit_client.py | Implementation infers toolkit status from application behavior | This matches the toolkit documentation, which doesn't provide direct status API | No issue - implementation correctly works around limitation | None needed | None |
| C03 | streams_client/crossdc_toolkit_client.py | Implementation uses instance and job status to infer toolkit state | This approach aligns with documentation showing toolkit's integration with application streams | No issue - implementation uses correct indirect monitoring strategy | None needed | None |
| C04 | streams_client/crossdc_toolkit_client.py:356-361 | "This is just a placeholder, as we don't have direct access to RemoteDataCenterStatus stream" | Documentation confirms toolkit uses SPL stream connections, not direct API | No issue - comment correctly identifies limitation | Could enhance by adding more detailed log analysis to detect toolkit state changes in streams | Minor |
| C05 | streams_client/crossdc_toolkit_client.py:415-443 | Looks for toolkit-related metrics in job and PE metrics | This is a good approach since toolkit state may be exposed via metrics | No issue - implementation correctly tries to find toolkit signals in available metrics | Consider adding specific metric patterns from toolkit documentation if available | Minor |
| C06 | orchestrator/test_orchestrator.py:309-342 | Uses CrossDCToolkitClient for failover monitoring | This matches recommended practice for monitoring toolkit status | No issue - implementation correctly uses toolkit client for status tracking | None needed | None |
| C07 | orchestrator/test_orchestrator.py:344-369 | Provides fallback to metrics-based detection | This is a good resilience strategy when toolkit integration isn't available | No issue - implementation correctly provides alternatives | None needed | None |

Test Case Definition Schema | "failover_trigger_method: How failover is initiated" | Documentation indicates failover is automatic based on DC status, not explicitly triggered | Minor - Implementation schema assumes direct control of failover timing | Update schema to focus on conditions that trigger failover rather than direct control | Minor |
