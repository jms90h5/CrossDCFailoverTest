# Comprehensive Review Plan

This document outlines the systematic approach for reviewing the Teracloud Streams Automated Cross-DC Failover Testing Framework against the official documentation.

## Documentation Resources

1. **Main Documentation**: https://doc.streams.teracloud.com
2. **REST Management API**: 
   - https://doc.streams.teracloud.com/com.ibm.streams.admin.doc/doc/managemonitorstreamsapi.html?hl=rest%2Cmanagement%2Capi%2Cservice
   - https://doc.streams.teracloud.com/external-reference/redoc-static.html
3. **Cross-DC Failover Toolkit**: https://doc.streams.teracloud.com/com.ibm.streams.toolkits.doc/spldoc/dita/tk$com.teracloud.streams.crossdcfailover/tk$com.teracloud.streams.crossdcfailover.html?hl=cross%2Cdc
4. **Data Exchange Interface**: https://doc.streams.teracloud.com/com.ibm.streams.dev.doc/doc/enabling-streams-data-exchange.html?hl=data%2Cexchange

## Review Phases

### Phase 1: Design Document Review
1. Read through Design_Plan_Condensed.txt completely
2. Cross-reference key assumptions with official documentation
3. Document specific discrepancies and their impact
4. Categorize issues by severity (critical/major/minor)
5. Focus areas:
   - REST API assumptions
   - Cross-DC Toolkit capabilities
   - Data Exchange Service functionality
   - Overall architectural approach

### Phase 2: Implementation Document Review
1. Read through Implementation_Plan_Condensed.txt completely
2. Cross-reference implementation approaches with recommended practices
3. Document specific discrepancies and their impact
4. Categorize issues by severity (critical/major/minor)
5. Focus areas:
   - API interaction patterns
   - Toolkit integration approach
   - Data handling methods
   - Authentication and security practices

### Phase 3: Code Review
1. Review files in priority order:
   - streams_client/api_client.py
   - streams_client/crossdc_toolkit_client.py
   - streams_client/data_exchange_client.py
   - orchestrator/test_orchestrator.py
   - fault_injection/*
   - data_handler/data_handler.py
   - monitoring/*
2. For each file:
   - Compare API usage with documentation
   - Evaluate error handling against recommended practices
   - Check for incorrect assumptions about functionality
3. Document specific discrepancies and their impact
4. Categorize issues by severity (critical/major/minor)

### Phase 4: Configuration and Test Scenarios Review
1. Review configuration approach and schemas
2. Evaluate test scenarios against documented capabilities
3. Check for incorrect assumptions in test expectations
4. Document specific discrepancies and their impact

### Phase 5: Comprehensive Summary
1. Compile all findings into a cohesive report
2. Prioritize issues that need correction
3. Prepare recommendations for each issue
4. Provide overall assessment of framework viability

## Tracking Progress

For each review phase, track:
- Percentage completion
- Key findings so far
- Areas needing deeper investigation
- Current page/file/line number when interrupted

## Documentation Approach

For each issue identified:
1. **Issue ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., D01, I05, C12)
2. **Location**: Document/file and line number
3. **Assumption Made**: What was assumed in the framework
4. **Actual Documentation**: What the official documentation states
5. **Impact**: How this affects the framework functionality
6. **Recommendation**: Specific changes needed
7. **Severity**: Critical/Major/Minor

## Resumption Strategy

When returning after a context window switch:
1. Re-read the current section of the review plan
2. Refer to the progress tracking information
3. Resume from the last documented point
4. Re-familiarize with key documentation resources as needed

## Detailed Document Review Table

Each document will be tracked in a table format:

| Section | Status | Issues Found | Next Section to Review |
|---------|--------|--------------|------------------------|
| 1. Introduction | Not Started | - | - |
| 2. Goals and Scope | Not Started | - | - |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Detailed Code Review Table

Each code file will be tracked in a table format:

| File | Status | Issues Found | Next Section to Review |
|------|--------|--------------|------------------------|
| api_client.py | Not Started | - | - |
| crossdc_toolkit_client.py | Not Started | - | - |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

This plan will be updated during the review process to maintain progress tracking through context window switches.
